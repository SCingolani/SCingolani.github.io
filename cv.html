<p>The semi-empirical method DFTB can achieve high quality results at a fraction of the cost of ab-initio methods. Given that its formalism is derived from the Density Functional Theory, its parameters are, in principle, readily obtainable. In practice, however, the magnitudes involved cannot be easily calculated without specialized software. A strategy that relies on the use of free and freely available software was developed and the parameters thereof obtained were validated against reference DFT calculations.</p>

<p>Different suspensions of ZnO nanoparticles obtained by mechanical milling were characterized by means of UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopies, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the nanoparticles were functionalized with 3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to try and improve their colloidal stability.</p>

<p>Experience developing small personal projects in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Haskell</strong> within Windows and Linux environments. Most of these projects consisted of very simple physics simulations, from N-body interactions, to rudimentary fluid dynamics simulations.
